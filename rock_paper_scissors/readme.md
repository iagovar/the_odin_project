## Rock, Paper, Scissors

Just a basic practice game with JS.

Python skills translate pretty well into Js, although using the inspector console is a bit weird, and the inspector itself packs a lot of information in a cramped space. It's possible to transform sections into windows, but still.

The script logic is somewat sanitized, but if you answer the propt with wrong strings it fails. Not too much to worry as it will be transformed into something else afterwards.
