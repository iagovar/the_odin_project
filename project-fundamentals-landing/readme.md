## Simple Landing Page

This project aims to put in practice some basic HTML & CSS knowledge, particularly the box model and flexbox.

The [exercise](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/landing-page) provides a couple of images recreating a landing page. The user (me) should just transform this images into html and styles.

There's no JS involved.
